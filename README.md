# Tic Tac Toe Android App (with Minimax AI)
A feature-rich Tic Tac Toe game developed using **Kotlin** and **Android Studio**, supporting both **two-player mode** and **single-player mode with AI**. The AI uses the **Minimax algorithm** to provide unbeatable gameplay in Hard difficulty, applying principles of **game theory** and **recursive decision-making**.

## Features
- Two-player local game mode
- Single-player mode with difficulty toggle:
  - **Easy**: AI selects random valid moves
  - **Hard**: AI uses **Minimax algorithm** for optimal play
- Clean and intuitive UI using XML layouts
- Responsive performance across Android devices
- Deployed and tested on Android Emulator (AVD)

## AI Logic – Minimax Algorithm
The Hard difficulty uses the Minimax algorithm to evaluate all possible future game states and select the move that maximizes the AI’s chances of winning (or minimizes loss). The algorithm is implemented recursively with backtracking to simulate turn-based decision making.
